# hdn-neon-arena-v5 (<i>Hidden:Source map<i>)
[Hidden:Source](https://www.hidden-source.com/)
This is the final version of the first map I created for Hidden:Source
The goal of this map was to make a map for phys-kills that could rival physics-arena
Original map inspired from Phenom's CS:GO map gg_neon_lights
Green/Blue glass squares are heavy, very easy to phys-kill with, good for inital learning but easy-mode for experienced players, funny to take out multiple players with.

- multiple versions of hdn-neon-arena map and associated custom textures, models, etc.
- bsp for downloading
